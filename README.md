# bouncingBalls


*** Work in progress ***


C++ program that will feature balls bouncing around the screen. Attempts to use realistic physics to model the behavior.

Planned features include allowing the user to move the balls, as well as
dynamically altering the number of balls. Plans also include obstacles and other
courses for the balls to traverse.


Install sfml-dev as well as g++: `sudo apt install sfml-dev g++ -y`

Compile with `g++ *.cpp -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`
